# FIR FILTER
This repository contains Vivado project files to recreate/modify the FIR Filter coefficients.
The FIR filter Coefficient used in this project are [1310.0, 4270.0, 6010.0, 4270.0, 1310.0] to get 5dB and -40dB attenuation at 0.2MHz and 46MHz respectively.

Hardware Acceleration of about 7 times.

## Plotting Function
Using Matplotlib

## Software (PS) Implementation
Using lfilter

## Hardware (PL) Implementation
Using PYNQ-Z1 board
